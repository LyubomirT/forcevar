# The Code of Conduct

Let's keep it short: We want to keep ForceVar a friendly and welcoming place for everyone. We do **__not__** tolerate any kind of harassment, discrimination, or any other form of abuse. We want to keep the community open and inclusive, and we want to make sure that everyone feels welcome and safe. And yes, this applies to everyone, including the maintainers and contributors.

If you see any kind of behavior that goes against this, please report it to us. We'll take care of it as soon as possible.

If you're not sure what's acceptable and what's not, you can check the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/) for more information.

## We kindly ask the moderators to swing the ban hammer with a passion if they see any kind of abuse. :)
